=== Providing an XML Schema for a RESTful Web Service

A web service client might prefer JSON over XML for various reasons but one obvious reason for
this preference is that client is a JavaScript program ready to treat the JSON response document as a
native JavaScript object. The JAX-B (Java API for XML-Binding) interfaces and classes offer a 
similiarly convenient way for a Java client of a RESTful service to treat an XML response document
as a native Java object; but some preparatory work is required. Here is a summary of how things
would work:

* The RESTful service offers client, in addition to its regular business operations, an XML Schema or
equivalent. The XML Schema specifies a grammar for the XML payload that the client receives.

* A Java client can apply JAX-B utilities to the XML Schema in order to generate native Java data types. 
For example, the Java client of the 'sayings' service could transform the XML list of predictions into a 
+List<Prediction>+ and then process this +List+ in some typical Java way. Languages other than Java have
utilities comparable to JAX-B.

Figure X depicts this scenario. 

The JAX-B utilities offer the client the chance to bypass XML parsing and, instead, to generate Java 
directly from XML. The next chapter goes into the JAX-B details; for now, the issue is how to generate
an XML Schema for the 'sayings' service.
