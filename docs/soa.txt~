Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture

It is common to link web services and service-oriented architecture (hereafter, SOA).
SOA, like REST itself, is more an architectural style--indeed, even a mindset--than a 
set of well-defined, strictly enforced rules for distributed systems. Perhaps the least
controversial aspect of SOA is that web services play a natural, important role within
this architecture.
