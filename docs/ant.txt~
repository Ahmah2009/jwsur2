Many of the book's sample web services are meant to be published with a
web server, in particular with Tomcat. This note explains an Ant script,
included in the ZIP file with all of the sample code, that automates 
deployment under Tomcat. The Ant utility, written in Java, is available
on all platforms. My script requires version 1.6 or greater.

To clarify the script basics, consider a web service that includes a
JSP script, a back-end JavaBean, the Tomcat deployment file web.xml,
and a JAR file that holds a Java library for processing JSON (JavaScript
Object Notation). Suppose that the Unixy directory /users/me/service1 or
Windows directory D:\service1 is the root for the service. For reference,
this directory is the cwd (current working directory) and it holds the
Ant script build.xml, depicted as follows:

        cwd = service1: build.xml

Under the cwd is a subdirectory named src

        service1: build.xml
           |
          src

that holds the JSP script, the JAR file, and the deployment file:

        service1: build.xml
           |
          src: products.jsp, json.jar, web.xml

Suppose that the back-end JavaBean is in a package named acme.org and
that the bean's fully qualified name is acme.org.Products. The layout is
now
        service1: build.xml
           |
          src: products.jsp, json.jar, web.xml
           |
          acme
           |
          org: Products.java
