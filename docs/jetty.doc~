The Jetty web server is available at http://jetty.codehaus.org as a ZIP file. Assume that JETTY_HOME
is the install directory. The subdirectories of JETTY_HOME are similar to those of TOMCAT_HOME. For
example, JETTY_HOME has a webapps subdirectory into which WAR files are deploy; a log subdirectory
with logging information; a lib subdirectory with various JAR files, including a versioned counterpart
of Tomcat's servlet-api.jar; and others.
