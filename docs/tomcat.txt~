Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org/) is a commercial-grade yet lightweight web server 
implemented in Java. Tomcat has various subsystems for administration, security, and like
but its central subsystem is Catalina, a container that executes servlets, including JSP
and other scripts (e.g., JSF) that Tomcat translates into servlets. Note 2 explains
an Ant script included in the code examples targeted at Tomcat. The Ant script eases the
task of deploying web services (and, for that matter, web sites) with Tomcat. This note
focuses on installing Tomcat and on basic post-installation tasks such as starting and
stopping the web server.



 Another such server is Jetty (http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/).
